# RepoClone Intelligence System

## System Identity
RepoClone is a self-aware template deployment system that enforces strict separation between backend logic and frontend project templates.

## Core Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Backend logic stays in RepoCloneMeta/backend-logic/
- **Root Intelligence**: Root level contains only intelligence files and project templates
- **Template Deployment**: Projects are created at root level, not within backend logic
- **Self-Awareness**: System monitors and enforces its own structure

## Intelligence Files
- README.md: System overview and usage
- INTELLIGENCE.md: This file - system self-awareness
- STRUCTURE_RULES.md: Enforced file organization rules
- package.json: Root system configuration
- index.js: Main intelligence script

## Enforcement
The system continuously monitors for:
- Forbidden directories at root level
- Missing intelligence files
- Improper file organization
- Structure violations

## Health Status
- Root Intelligence: Active
- AI Monitor: Running
- Structure Enforcement: Enabled
- Template System: Operational
