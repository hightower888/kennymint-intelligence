# RepoClone Intelligence System

## System Identity
RepoClone is a **root-level intelligence system** that maintains and enforces clean project structure with self-awareness.

## Core Principles
- **Root-Level Intelligence**: All intelligence systems operate at the root level
- **Self-Awareness**: System monitors and enforces its own structure
- **Clean Organization**: No mixing of frontend and backend code
- **Structure Validation**: Ensures proper file and directory organization

## Intelligence Files
- `root-intelligence-enforcer.js`: Main intelligence system
- `README.md`: System overview and usage
- `INTELLIGENCE.md`: This file - system self-awareness
- `package.json`: Root system configuration

## System Capabilities

### üß† Self-Awareness
- Knows its identity as a root-level intelligence system
- Understands its purpose of maintaining clean structure
- Monitors its own health and status
- Enforces its own rules

### üìã Structure Validation
- Validates required directories exist (CORE, TEMPLATES, DOCS, ARCHIVE)
- Ensures root intelligence files are present
- Checks that backend logic is properly archived
- Prevents backend logic at root level

### üõ°Ô∏è Rule Enforcement
- Enforces clean separation of concerns
- Prevents structure violations
- Maintains proper organization
- Monitors system health

## Health Status
- ‚úÖ **Root Intelligence**: Active and self-aware
- ‚úÖ **Structure Validation**: Working and enforced
- ‚úÖ **Rule Enforcement**: Active and monitoring
- ‚úÖ **System Health**: All systems operational

## Current Scope
This is a **simplified root-level intelligence system** focused on:
- Self-awareness and structure validation
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper project organization
- System health monitoring

## Next Phase
Once root-level intelligence is fully working, we'll add:
1. **Template Deployment** - Deploy project templates
2. **Project Creation** - Create new projects from templates
3. **Advanced Features** - Additional intelligence capabilities

## Commands
- `npm start` - Run root intelligence operations
- `npm run validate` - Validate project structure
- `npm run enforce` - Enforce structure rules
- `npm run status` - Check system status
