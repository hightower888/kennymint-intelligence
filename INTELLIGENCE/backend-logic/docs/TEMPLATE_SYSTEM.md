# Backend Template System Documentation

## How Templates Work

This documentation explains how the backend engine creates and manages project templates.

## Template Creation Process

### 1. Project Structure Generation
The backend uses intelligent templates to create project-specific folder structures:

```
[project-name]/
├── config/               # Project configuration
├── brand-guidelines/     # Brand-specific rules and assets
├── assets/              # Generated and curated assets
├── data-stores/         # Project-specific data storage
├── learning-data/       # AI learning and adaptation data
└── workflows/           # Custom workflow definitions
```

### 2. File Schema Rules

The backend follows these schema rules when creating project files:

**Configuration Files:**
- `project-context.json`: Core project metadata and settings
- `brand-guidelines.json`: Brand rules, colors, fonts, and restrictions
- `workflow-config.json`: Custom workflow definitions

**Asset Management:**
- Automatic folder creation based on asset types needed
- Brand compliance checking for all generated assets
- Version control for asset iterations

### 3. Environment Configuration

The backend manages environment variables through:

**Template Rules:**
- Industry-specific variable sets
- Security-first configuration patterns
- Scalability considerations built-in

**Population Logic:**
- Context-aware variable selection
- Secure default generation
- Project-type optimization

### 4. Brand Guidelines Integration

**Learning System:**
- Captures user corrections and preferences
- Locks rules when explicitly confirmed
- Prevents unauthorized brand changes

**Enforcement Engine:**
- Real-time compliance checking
- Asset generation with brand constraints
- Context-aware adaptations

### 5. Smart Asset Integration

**Asset Discovery:**
- Automatic relevant asset search
- AI-powered asset generation
- Multi-format optimization (headers, icons, logos, banners)

**Asset Management:**
- Reusable asset library creation
- Usage tracking and optimization
- Brand-compliant generation

## Backend Processing Rules

### File Creation Logic
1. Analyze project context (industry, audience, purpose)
2. Select appropriate templates from backend library
3. Generate context-specific configurations
4. Apply brand guidelines and restrictions
5. Create optimized file structure

### Scaling Adaptation
The backend automatically adapts structure based on:
- Project complexity indicators
- Data volume thresholds
- Performance requirements
- Team size considerations

### Security Implementation
- Encrypted storage for sensitive configurations
- Access control pattern enforcement
- Audit logging for all template operations
- Secure key management integration

## Template Customization Rules

### Industry Templates
- Technology: Modern, performance-focused configurations
- Healthcare: Compliance and security-first templates
- Finance: Regulatory and audit-ready structures
- Creative: Asset-heavy, brand-focused layouts

### Audience Adaptations
- Business Professionals: Corporate standards and practices
- Developers: Technical optimization and efficiency
- End Users: Simplicity and usability focus
- Stakeholders: Reporting and visibility emphasis
