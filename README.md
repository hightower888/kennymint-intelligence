# RepoClone - Root-Level Intelligence System

## What This Is

RepoClone is a **self-aware intelligence system** that maintains and enforces clean project structure. It's designed to:

- **Maintain self-awareness** - Knows what it is and what it's supposed to do
- **Enforce structure rules** - Keeps backend logic separate from frontend projects
- **Validate organization** - Ensures proper file and directory structure
- **Learn from patterns** - Understands how projects should be organized

## How It Works

The system operates at the **root level** and:

1. **Checks self-awareness** - Validates its identity and purpose
2. **Validates structure** - Ensures backend logic is in the right place
3. **Enforces rules** - Prevents mixing of frontend and backend code
4. **Monitors health** - Tracks system status and violations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run root intelligence
npm start

# Validate structure
npm run validate

# Check system status
npm run status
```

## Core Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Backend logic stays in `INTELLIGENCE/RepoCloneMeta/backend-logic/`
- **Root Intelligence**: Root level contains only intelligence files and project templates
- **Self-Awareness**: System monitors and enforces its own structure
- **Clean Organization**: No mixing of frontend and backend code

## System Status

The intelligence system continuously monitors:

- ✅ **Self-Awareness**: Knows its identity and purpose
- ✅ **Structure Validation**: Ensures proper file organization
- ✅ **Rule Enforcement**: Prevents structure violations
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Tracks system status

## Commands

- `npm start` - Run root intelligence operations
- `npm run validate` - Validate project structure
- `npm run enforce` - Enforce structure rules
- `npm run status` - Check system status

## Next Steps

Once the root-level intelligence is fully working, we'll add:

1. **Template Deployment** - Deploy project templates
2. **Project Creation** - Create new projects from templates
3. **Advanced Features** - Additional intelligence capabilities

## Development

This is a **root-level intelligence system** focused on:
- Self-awareness and structure validation
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper project organization
- System health monitoring

The goal is to get this core intelligence working perfectly before adding template deployment functionality.
